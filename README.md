Project Topic: H-1B issuing prediction on Spark and Cluster

Main Goal: discovered if the performance of accuracy and speed would be better when running spark in cluster rather than local.

Project Procedure:
  1. Get the data from Kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa).
  2. Data cleaning and EDA analysis to deal with missing values and outliers.
  3. Transfomred the features by applying clustering and text clustering
  4. Used different models to test if the model with parallel computing would have a faster performance in spark cluster.
